# Game-App-Reviews-Analysis
The playability of a game depends on the players' experience in terms of functionality, usability, and satisfaction. Mobile gaming has recently evolved because of the availability of suitable hardware, configurable mobile devices, and the ability to download games from the Android and iOS platforms. 
Most online gaming stores allow customers to submit their reviews about gameplay, issues, and functionalities publicly. Game developers can better grasp such consumer issues by examining player feedback and increasing how well-liked a game is among players. 
We have mapped the playability of Sánchez's model with Schwartz's theory of human values and analyzed 20,346 user/player reviews from the top 15 game apps in the Google Play Store. We have also created a labelled dataset of each playability category of Sánchez's model. 
Finally, we applied a machine learning model to support the automatic classification of a review to a specific playability category violation. Our analysis shows that 30% of the reviews show human values violations, consequently affecting game playability. We found that Socialism is the most violated and Emotion is the least violated value category. We also found that only 18% of the user reviews received responses from the game app developers for the value violations. 
Using fine-grained feature extraction, we found the top 42 functionalities, issues, and concerns for the violations. The analysis results of our study give developers a foundation for creating apps that consider users' values for ensuring better playability of mobile game apps.
